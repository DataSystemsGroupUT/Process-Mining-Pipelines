- This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for distributed Process Mining (PM) data pipelines. It relies on the theoretical concepts of: 

</br>

1. graphs:
	- Directly-Follows Graph (DFG)
	- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
2. database:
	- Neo4J graph db (via database .jar connector)
3. data analysis:
	- distributed analytical engine, i.e., Apache Spark
		- interface: PySpark
	- PM4Py Process Mining algorithms (Python-based package)


## PROCESS MINING PIPELINE: WORKFLOW

- log files, i.e., *.csv* files
	- Apache Spark via PySpark interface
		- data partitioning (by case ID) and time windowing (by timestamps)
			- Directly-Follows Graph schema, i.e., *predecessor(s)* and *successor(s)* nodes
				- WRITE queries to a Neo4J graph database
					- format conversion for algorithmic analysis, i.e., Parent/Child nodes and their frequency
						- derive Petri net objects and put them within dataframes
							- PM4Py analysis by applying - in parallel to DFGs - Process Mining algorithms, i.e.,   
								1. Î±-miner
								2. heuristic miner
								3. inductive miner
									- plotting of evaluation metrics via comparative charts from the dataframes - derived by converting Resilient Distributed Database (RDD)s to Pandas
